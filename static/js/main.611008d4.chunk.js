It is notable in part for reflecting popular American sentiments of the times, when many saw pastoralism as the ideal phase of human civilization, fearing that empire would lead to gluttony and inevitable decay. The theme of cycles is one that Cole returned to frequently, such as in his The Voyage of Life series. The Course of Empire comprises the following works: The Course of Empire \u2013 The Savage State; The Arcadian or Pastoral State; The Consummation of Empire; Destruction; and Desolation. All the paintings are oil on canvas, and all are 39.5 inches by 63.5 inches (100 cm by 161 cm) except The Consummation of Empire which is 51\u2033 by 76\u2033 (130 cm by 193 cm).","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg/1280px-Cole_Thomas_The_Course_of_Empire_Destruction_1836.jpg"]),e.push(["The Fallen Angel","The L\u2019Ange Dechu, or Fallen Angel, may be one of the hottest artworks ever made.
